# Install FHICT specifics

## Requirements
- You should have Python aready instaled. If not go to [installPython](installPython) first. 

## FHICT Python Package

If you have `miniconda` or `anaconda` installed that could lead to confusion. If you don't need it you could consider uninstalling it. 

If you install the FHICT Python package you have all you need for S1. Open a CLI (remember? [CLI](docs/cli/index)) and type: 

If you are in ms-Windows: 

```
py -m pip install fhict-cb-01
```

For other operating systems: 
```
pip install fhict-cb-01
```
