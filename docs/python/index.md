# Python environment setup

You will be learning the basics of programming with
[Python](https://www.python.org/).

We will describe the following steps to get started:

1. Install Python
2. Install Visual Studio Code
3. Install the FHICT Python package

## 1. and 2. Python and Visual Studio Code

For the first two steps: follow the instructions fromand
[this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial),
which will tell you how to install Python itself and also
`Visual Studio Code`, an editor to write Python code in.

## 3. Install the FHICT Python package

The following page shows you how to install a [Python package](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/).
You will need this package during the first 9 weeks of the start semester.

You should have Python already installed.
Furthermore `miniconda` or `anaconda` are not required. Feel free to uninstall these applications if you don't know what these do.

### Steps

1. Open a Command Line Interface (see [here](../cli) for more information)
2. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install fhict-cb-01
```
