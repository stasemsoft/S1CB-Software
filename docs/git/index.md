# Getting started with Git 

## Why? 

One of the most important tools in every Software Engineers' toolbox is version control! Nowadays we use ***git*** as a default for that. In git one can create a so-called `repository` which is a store for files and directories, and which gives you control over different versions of your files, and also makes it easier to work together on a project. 



FHICT has its own git-server for students which you can find via StudentSquare or directly: 
[git.fhict.nl](https://git.fhict.nl). A popular server where you can share your projects to the whole world is 
[github.com](https://github.com).  



## git basic concepts

When reading the story below you can use this as a cheat sheet: 

+ clone:             make local copy of the repository. 
+ checkout:          apppoint one version to your current 'working directory'
+ commit:            put changes that were made in the working dir into the local repos. 
+ push:              the new commits that were made local will be sent to the
  server repo also. 
+ pull:             Take all new changes that are on the server (typically
  changes made by other developers) and add to your local repository 


The first concept we have to grasp is that of a `repository`: you could see a
repository like a datastore, where files can be stored in directories. 

![](figures/gitpictures-0 - Start.jpg "git start")

Suppose there is a `repository` on a `git server` containing a project you are going to work on. To start working on it you first `clone` the project: this means `git` will create a local copy of the repository, including the history of all files in the project. The last version of the files will be appointed as `working dir`. You can edit your files locally in this working dir the way you normally do: can be done with any editor, or using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 

When you made some changes to your local working dir you may want to `commit` those changes to the local history. After that you can `push` these new versions to the git server. When changes are pushed to the server other developers can `pull` your changes to their local versions. 

Next time you don't need to create a new clone, but before creating new changes yourself it is wise to `pull` possible changes made by other people (and pushed by them to the server) from the git server to your local repository and point your working working dir to this version. After that you can (again) develop until you have changes that commit and push to the server again. 

Sometimes you create a local change, commmit it locally, and when pushing it turns out that someone else pushed a change to the server: if it is in the same file we can have a `merge conflict`: before you will be able to push your change to the server you first have to `merge` the changes created by the other person into your working version. After that you can push your changes to the server. 


When using a language which has `source files` (like '.cs'-files) and `compiled files` (like '.exe'-files) then normally you will only want to add the source files to your git repository. By  creating a so-called '.gitignore'-file git will know which files to ignore, so these will not be added to the repository. Examples can be found at 
[gitignore-examples](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/gitignore-examples/). 


## Git command line

When you have git installed you will have a git command line tool. We will explain how to perform the basic actions from this CLI. After that you could look into using some GUI-Git-tool (for example Git Kraken, Git Desktop, Git GUI, Git Extensions, Git Tortoise, SmartGit). Also a lot of IDE's have Git built-in. 



### Create a repository

![](figures/git_newproject.png "new project")
A repository is a place (typically online) where your code and
all previous versions of it are stored. We will now create a repository at
the so-called *git-lab* environment at FHICT
(only available for FHICT-students;
An alternative would be creating a repository at *GitHub.com*,
which is very similar, but then the whole world can potentially see what you are doing)
Use a browser to go 
[https://git.fhict.nl](https://git.fhict.nl)
and create a git repository.
Copy the https-url to your clipboard, we need it in a few moments.

![](figures/gitHttpsUrl.png "git https")

In Git you typically have a `repository` on a network somewhere where
all files of your project are stored, including the history of
`commits` to those files.
Furthermore you have a  `local repository` with all source code versions
which you regularly `synchronize` (using `push` and `pull`) with
the remote repository on a server.
Other people in your team sync with the same remote repository.

### Clone the repository

Next step is creating a so-called `clone` locally on your laptop.
This will be your workspace where you can develop.
By keeping it up to date with the server
(`pushing` your changes to the server
and `pulling` the changes of other developers from the server)
you can work together with other developers.

You can choose between several *tools* to do the `pulling`
and `pushing`,
some created to be easy to use and some more advanced.
Here the *command line* is used: the advantages being that **all**
`git`-functionality is available from the command line or CLI. 
[Sarters-info on the CLI](../cli)

So start a `terminal` or `bash` shell.
Go to the `directory` where you want your workspace to be.
In the starters info you find explained how to create a directory with `mkdir`, change your working dir with `cd`.  

So, to create dir 'myProject' in an already existing dir 'Documents' you could type the commands:

```
cd Documents
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
```

Most of the time you don't have to type whole names like *Documents*:
just type *Doc* and
press the *tab* key and probably the *shell* will complete the name.

![](figures/gitbash1.png "bash")

In the CLI 'clone' the git-repository from the server
to your local directory by typing:

```
git clone pasteYourGitUrlHere
```

After that (you will be asked for your 'username'/'password')
you now have a local copy ('clone') of the entire history of this repository
(for a just created project this is still empty).
To go inside the local 'repository-directory',
which after a 'clone' contains the 'latest' version of the files,
use

```
cd dirname
```

Do you want to know what the status of git is? 

```bash
git status
```

tells you that (at this moment)
thereâ€™s nothing to commit (which means you don't have made local changes
to the repository).

After this you can start editing your files in your fancy-editor-of-choice (IDE). 
For this info-page that means we'll have an intermission until you have changes
that you want to commit to git. 

[Intermission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0wOD9TWynM)

We now assume you have some changes you want to commit (locally) and then push to the server. 
Most often you can do that from your IDE: and that is a valid option! On this
page we will continu describing how to do it from the CLI. 

```bash
git status 
```

Before committing we have to `stage` the changes (telling git what has to be
committed): 

```bash
git add * 
```

or (to explicitly `stage` a specific file: 

```bash
git add theFilename
```

If you want to see what will be committed you can of course always: 

```bash
git status 
```

Ready to commit?

```bash
git commit -m "adding some comment"
```

The '-m' tells git that the string after it is the description of what is in the
commit: add some comment there that describes your changes. You could just say
`git commit`: git will then start your favorite editor to let you edit the
commment. In general it's easier to add it right away? 

```bash
git status 
```

In the status info you see that you are 1 commit ahead of the server. This means
that you have 1 commit locally (in your local copy of the repository) that still
has to be `push`ed to the git server: 

```bash
git push
```

If noone pushed changes to the server than your commit will succesfully be
pushed to the server, which we can check with (again) `git status`. If someone
*did* push changes to the server then git will (aks and) try to `merge` those changes into your local repos, after which you can push your changes together with the merged ones. 

## Next development session

When you start working on new changes it is wise to start with a 

```bash
git pull
```

so you get all the changes pushed to the server in the meanwhile. 


Remark: The way-of-work described on this page is a simpel one: a lot of developers
use some kind of so-called branch-based workflow, but that's out of our scope
for now.
