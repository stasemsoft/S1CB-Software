# Getting started with Git 

## Why? 

One of the most important tools in every Software Engineers' toolbox is version control! Nowadays we use ***git*** as a default for that. In git one can create a so-called `repository` which is a store for files and directories, and which gives you control over different versions of your files, and also makes it easier to work together on a project. 

FHICT has its own git-server for students which you can find via StudentSquare or directly: 
[git.fhict.nl](https://git.fhict.nl). A popular server on the internet where you can share your projects to the whole world is 
[github.com](https://github.com).
