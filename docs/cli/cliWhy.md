# Why learn to use the CLI?

Nowadays we are used to be able to do almost every computer action with GUI apps. These are built by programmers (if you want you can read 'Software Engineer' instead of programmer) to make our life easier, because they hide some technical parts away from us. Well, if you want to be a programmer, cloud/network engineer yourself then it turns out to be useful to know a bit about the CLI. 

For students in FHICT semester 1: there are some moments when you will encounter the CLI: when configuring Python using `pip install` (to install Flask for example), and also when `Git` is introduced.
