# What is a CLI?

With Command Line Interface (CLI) we mean 'some window in which we can interact with our machine'. Other terms that are used for CLI are: `console`, `terminal`, `terminal emulator`, `bash`, or `shell`.

In Windows one can have different Commmand Line Interfaces:

- `Command Prompt` was the first to be built in windows (by Microsoft itself).
- `PowerShell` was later built to extend the possibilities (by Microsoft itself).
- `Unix Shell` is a CLI that is available for all Unix compatible machines (amongst others Linux and MacOS). In Windows you can have a `unix shell` by enabling the so-called `Linux subsystem for Windows`. If you have installed `Git` you also have `Git Bash`, which is also a unix shell.

The big advantage of a CLI is that regardless which one you choose, commands across CLIs are universal. The sole exception being `Command Prompt`, which is why **discourage** using it.
