# What do we mean with 'CLI'? 

With CLI or Command Line Interface we mean 'some window in which we can interact with our machine'. Sometimes we talk about `Console`, sometimes about `Terminal` or `Terminal emulator`, about `Bash` or `Shell`. 

In ms-Windows one can have different Commmand Line interfaces: 
- `Command Shell` was the first to be built in windows (by Microsoft itself). 
- `PowerShell` was later built to extend the possibilities (by Microsoft itself). 
- `Unix Shell` is a CLI that is available for all Unix compatible machines (amongst others Linux and MacOS). In ms-Windows you can have a `unix shell` by enabling the so-called `Linux subsystem for Windows`. If you have installed `Git` you also have `Git Bash`, which is also a unix shell. 

On every system that you could be working on there is a unix shell available, so we will use this one in these pages, athough most, if not all, of what we do here, could be done using one of the other options.
