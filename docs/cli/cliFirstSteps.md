# First steps with the CLI

## Where am I? 

After having started your CLI the way it was explained before, a good idea is to see 'where' we are: A CLI points to a so-called `working directory`. Type `pwd` to, well, Print the Working Directory: 

```
pwd
```
(`enter` always executes the command, as you probably know, so we will not repeat that. Remember: we will not repeat that)
