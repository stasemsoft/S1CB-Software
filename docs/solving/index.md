# Python/Flask trouble Shooting

This page is to help you get up and running again when stuck with one of the python/flask/arduino-tasks in semester 1 course based.

## Strategy to tackle a problem

You *will* get stuck now and then, so it makes sense to have a more or less structured way to cope with that. So try to be aware of what you do when solving a problem. It will help you get better in time. 

Several short tips:

- What was your last change? Could it have caused the problem you are now facing?
- Is there an error or other kin of message that tries to tell you what's wrong?
- Can you put a breakpoint somewhere and start debugging?
- If you were doing a tutorial or other instruction: did I understand what action I was performing (and why)?
