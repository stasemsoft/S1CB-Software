## Some considerations
- 202211: When students were installing Python/Flask, without explanation, they got some commands to do on the CLI (Command Line Interface), which led to a lot of students not being able to do so themselves, also involving a lot of teacher effort to get it right. A few weeks later students got an instruction about using git (done by a student). For that also the CLI was used, but was (still) new to most of them. When doing Python, most students only knew how to edit/run programs from VS Code. They did not really know about the files or how to run Python from the CLI (or even that it could be done from CLI).
- Every year we see new 

# Why Unix CLI? 
Most students use msWin. Still we chose Unix CLI, That's because it's available on every system: msWin, Linux and MacOS. 
On `msWin` to get a Unix CLI you can install git: after installation you have `Git bash`! 


# Why git from CLI? 
We see new GUI-apps for using git every year. There is one 'constant' way to use git: the command line. Furthermore: from the CLI you can use *all* of its functionality, which is not true for all GUIs. We think every Software Engineer should have at least 'some' idea of how to use the command line.
